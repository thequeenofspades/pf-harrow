# Pathfinder Harrow

This is a minimalistic web app designed to allow Pathfinder GMs to perform virtual harrow readings for their players.

## Backstory

During the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, I found myself gearing up to run the Curse of the Crimson Throne AP for my friends... online. _What to do with this fancy physical harrow deck I bought?_ I asked myself. I briefly imagined holding up cards to my webcam, one at a time. No, there had to be a better solution. So with 5 days until my campaign was due to begin, I decided to create a web app.

Now you, fellow Pathfinder GM, can use my pandemic project to help you practice your harrow readings or do full-fledged readings for your remote players.

## Coming soon

I honestly don't know if, when, or how I'll be updating this web app. So if you have a feature request or a bug report, file an issue and see what happens, I guess.
